# Give Back Browser Control

Sometimes sites try to take away your ability to cut/copy/paste and
even right click. This attemps to solve that.

I only tested this on Firefox.

## Installation

* Create a new bookmark in your browser
* Add contents of [giveBackControlBookmark.js](giveBackControlBookmark.js) as the bookmark "location"

## Usage

When on a page where the ability to right-click or cut/copy/paste
is suppressed, click on the bookmark to re-enable your browser's
features.
